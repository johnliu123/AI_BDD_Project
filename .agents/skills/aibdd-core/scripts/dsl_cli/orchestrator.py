"""Wire dsl_cli modules into the two top-level commands.

`run_generate_dsl_instructions(...)`: HARNESS phase.
  parse specs → diff against resolved entries → load preset plugin →
  call plugin.generate_templates(unresolved) → route templates per file →
  append each bucket → return GenerationReport.

`run_eval(...)`: EVAL phase.
  load dsl files → optionally collect shared-dsl name namespace → run
  universal rule chain → return EvalReport.

Neither function reads cwd. Caller passes all paths (specs, dsl, shared-dsl,
boundaries_root) — for production, aibdd-plan SOP resolves these from
arguments.yml before invoking.
