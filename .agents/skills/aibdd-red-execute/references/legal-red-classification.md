# Legal Red Classification

Legal red means the test environment is healthy and the remaining failure proves
a behavioral gap.

## Legal Red Types

- `value_difference`: the runner reached the intended assertion and observed an
  actual value different from the expected value.
- `expected_exception`: the scenario expects an exception or failure outcome, but
  the product did not produce it.

## False Red Types

These failures are not legal red:

- compile error, syntax error, import error, or runner load error
- missing step, skipped Scenario, or invisible runtime feature
- fixture/helper load failure outside the behavior under test
- step definition body containing `pass`, empty body, placeholder throw, or
  `RED-PENDING`
- DSL entry missing, ambiguous, or invented during Red
- datatable shape mismatch against `datatable_bindings`
- dynamic ID alias that cannot resolve to declared Scenario or fixture truth
- preset handler that cannot resolve to core boundary assets
- handler forbidden surface in generated step-def body
- direct import of production internals instead of using the DSL surface
- renderer-inferred endpoint, field, id, or default value not present in truth

## Routing

- DSL entry, datatable, Example, or dynamic ID problems route to
  `/aibdd-spec-by-example-analyze`.
- Missing contracts/data DSL corpus, empty corpus, binding coverage, or preset
  handler problems route to `/aibdd-plan`.
- Runtime archive, runner visibility, fixture extension, or glob problems route
  to project-owned BDD stack configuration.

## Red Loop Budget

Red has a hard attempt budget defined by runtime or loop-budget policy. When the
budget is exhausted without legal red, the skill emits a stop report instead of
silently retrying.
